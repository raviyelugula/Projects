###2.Data Fetching
* Define your twitter authentication details (this part of code is hidden)

##5.Topic Modeling 
Here we found to
```{r echo=FALSE}
  consumerkey = "MTfL0uv6oBbtVBa3dPuR4PS51"
  consumersecret = "T480vrOtvSK1XxGcPp20SdRoW99by3EGVvAapzyq8io0uH6lUh"
  accesstoken = "191958252-uOisKMkvWHWmiTRQnf9d6XMww5wtZVtox1ShcjMm"
  accesssecret = "9kTTYtORX4KnXk9SG4R9bQ1PpmQyBYEwmfvDksTh6Wht0"
```
* Establish a connect with twitter developer API by passing the authentication details to `setup_twitter_oauth` function.
* Pull recent 2,500 tweets containing the hash tag **#ThursdayThoughts**.
* Store the tweets in a dataframe and convert it to corpus.
We focused on fetching the tweets with `#ThursdayThoughts` from twitter and analyse the sentiments.
Following are the necesssary libraries that are needed.

```{r cars,eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
PepsiTweets =  searchTwitter(searchString ='Pepsi',
                       n=10 , lang = 'en') 
```
* Establish a connect with twitter `developer` API by passing the authentication details to 'setup_twitter_oauth' function.
* Pull recent 2,500 tweets containing the hash tag '#ThursdayThoughts'.
* Store
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
